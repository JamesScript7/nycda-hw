Hi,

I currently work at a bass amp company, Aguilar Amplification, as a Production Assistant of Quality Control.

I graduated from St. John's University and Institute of Audio Research. My major is Audio Engineering with a concentration in business, and copywriting for advertising.

I've been interested in web development for a while but now I finally felt ready to take the next step into making it into a career. Websites such as freecodecamp, codecademy, and codeschool helped me understand some of the foundations in coding.

I'm glad this course is programming focused. I know how to write some basic algorithms and use basic methods. It's extremely satisfying when a code runs and works the way I intended! I hope to learn a lot and become a proficient web developer.
